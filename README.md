# IDC

#### Also check TUTORIAL.MD to get install instaructions
#### And TODO.txt to see future features
IDC will be a block-based coding app for C++ when done. Currently, there's less than 50% coded, but it already features:

- Low memory usage - initially consuming 150 MB, 
spamming blocks makes it increase very slowly (5 blocks = max. 1 additional MB consumed)

- Blocks - everything except converting to code

- Addons - everything except dependencies on other addons done

- Options - overall done, but will add new options

- Backend - after a few adjustments, you can make it compile a C++ project

- Block selection menu - completely done
