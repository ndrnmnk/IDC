# IDC

#### Also check TUTORIAL.MD to get install instaructions
#### And TODO.txt to see future features
IDC will be a block-based coding app with addons support. Currently, it's far from done, but it already features:

- Blocks - everything works except converting to code (addons do this) and layer deletion from dynamic ones

- UI - need to restructure textures and sounds as files

- Options - overall done, but will add new options

- Block selection menu - done

- Addons - done
